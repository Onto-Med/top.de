![Terminology- and Ontology-based Phenotyping (TOP) Framework Overview: TOP enables phenotypic queries on patient or study database and ontology-based document search for medical documents.](public/framework_overview.svg)

The goal of the project is the development and application of an ontology-based framework for complex patient phenotypes (TOP Framework).
The project is based on the structured medical data of the data integration centres of the [Medical Informatics Initiative (MII)](https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/en/consortia/data-integration-centres).
The concept is developed alongside the use cases of the [SMITH Consortium](https://www.smith.care),
though it is not limited to these and is to be applicable for many use cases of the MII Consortia and comparable projects in the medical domain in the future.
For this, a concept of a modular web application will be implemented, which combines many software tools and services for algorithmical phenotyping.
These tools and services provide data entities and phenotype-algorithms in standardized repositories and feature interfaces for linking external data repositories and importing existing metadata. 
The framework wants to support medical and clinical experts (medical staff, biometricians, student assistants, statisticians, etc.) in identifying patients and proposoti relevant for further analyses and studies.
It allows to select the data relevant for this group at a data integration centre and provide it for following steps.
By this, the data can be analyzed to calculate derivatives, scores and further classfications.
The specified metadata and phenotype algorithms/models will be published in a web repository and will be made accessible yb standardised interfaces.
